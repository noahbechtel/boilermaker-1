        I was born and raised outside of Columbia, Missouri. I grew up with a
        love for coding, starting with Scratch and then tinkering with Rasberry
        Pis and Arduino. There were not many outlets for my passion in my small
        rural town, but I found small ways to express myself through ways like
        automating watering at a greenhouse I worked for, creating small
        internal tools for a Mom & Pop harware store, and creating an email
        automation system for a Realty company. This changed when I was making a
        move to Woodstock, New York, and I stopped for a few days at my uncle's
        home. He suggested I take a look into Fullstack Academy of Code.
        Fullstack had an intro to Javascript course to prepare students for the
        immersive bootcamp. I enrolled in the course and continued to progress
        until I qualified for the bootcamp. There, I really discovered my
        passion, and through hundreds of hours of training, numerous production
        level projects, and not mention several of the strongest relationships
        I've ever created, became the developer I am now. I continue to grow my
        skills and passion for coding through daily study and projects exploring
        the community and ever-advancing world of computer science!
