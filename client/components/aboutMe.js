        I was born and raised outside of Columbia, Missouri. I grew up with a
        love for coding, starting with Scratch and then tinkinging with Rasberry
        Pis and Arduino. There were not many outlets for my passion in my small
        rural town, but found small ways to express myself through ways like
        automating wating at a greenhouse I worked for, creating samll internal
        tools for a Mom & Pop harware store, and creating a email automation
        system for a Realty company. This changed when I was making a move to
        Woodstock, New York and I stopped for a few days at my uncle's home. He
        suggested I take a look into Fullstack Academy of Code. They had a intro
        to Javascript course to prepare you for their immersive bootcamp. I
        agreed to take the class, and continue the tiers until I failed. This
        progressed until I qualified for the bootcamp. There I really discovered
        my passion, and through hundreds of hours of training, numerous
        production level projects, and not mention several of the strongest
        relationships I've ever created, became the developer I am now. I
        continue to grow my skills each day, and continue to grow my passion for
        coding!
