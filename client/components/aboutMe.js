          I was born and raised outside of Columbia, Missouri. I grew up with a
          love for coding, starting with Scratch and then gaining experience
          with Rasberry Pis and Arduino. There were not many outlets for my
          passion in my small rural town, but I found small ways to express
          myself through ways like automating watering at a greenhouse I worked
          for, creating small internal tools for a Mom & Pop harware store. I
          then moved to CHicago and enrolled in Fullstack Academy of Code.
          There, I really discovered my passion, and through hundreds of hours
          of training, numerous production level projects, and not mention
          several of the strongest relationships I've ever created, became the
          developer I am now. I continue to grow my skills and passion for
          coding through daily study and projects exploring the community and
          ever-advancing world of computer science!
